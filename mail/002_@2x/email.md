We’re sending this mail to the small group of people who have attended Úll at least twice. You have been a great support to us, and we couldn’t be more grateful. Úll tickets go on sale next week, but we want to give you the chance to purchase your ticket first, along with a discount to show our appreciation. This is exclusive to a very small group of you: please keep it to yourself for now!

There are two ticket options. As our most loyal attendees, we want you to have the first chance to purchase either option with a €100 discount: https://ti.to/ull/2015/?release_ids=5k7dssxo3ye,cwj1opsuzja&discount_code=ULLDENSCOTH@2X

Úll 2015 will happen in Killarney, in the south-west of Ireland and the venue is the 5-Star Europe hotel. We’ve been, and it is simply wonderful. You couldn’t wish for a better venue. We’re super-excited. Take a look at the pre-launch site to learn more about our plans as they take shape: http://2015.ull.ie/pre/launch.html

We hope to see you again in 2015!
