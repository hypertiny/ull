Úll tickets go on sale next week, but we want to give you the chance to purchase your ticket first, along with a discount to show our appreciation. This is exclusive to a very small group of you: Please keep it to yourself for now!

Úll 2015 will happen in Killarney, in the south-west of Ireland and the venue is the 5-Star Europe hotel. We’ve been, and it is simply wonderful. You couldn’t wish for a better venue. We’re super-excited. Take a look at the pre-launch site to learn more about our plans as they take shape: http://2015.ull.ie/pre/launch.html

We hope to see you again in 2015!
