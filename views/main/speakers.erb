      Back in 2009 a small group appeared on Flickr featuring parodies of the infamous Keep Calm and Carry On poster. I was doing a lot of tongue-in-cheek digital illustration at the time so over a few days submitted a number of my own contributions to the group. Some of these have become quite popular, one receiving over 18,000 views.

      Over the last two years a number of folk have got in touch to see if any of these designs are available to buy as prints or tees. I have dabbled with the idea and put a couple of tee designs up on Spreadshirt last year. However I recently decided to try and take this a bit more seriously so have commissioned some screen prints of two of the more popular designs which are due back from the printer any day now.

      Look at your typical website. Unless you're looking at canhascheezburger.com then the majority of the pages will be text. This is why typography is an integral part of what we do and we digitally build upon techniques that have been honed from centuries of man's love of type.

     Each morning begins with a 10 a.m. breakfast at Kanye’s Diamondhead residence. Pusha, Tip, RZA, Cudi, Cons, and Kanye’s crew slowly assemble to enjoy the absurdly tasty cooking of Kanye’s in-house chefs. If you’re smart, you order the French toast with the flambéed banana. An hour later, Kanye pulls up in his Porsche Panamera, fresh from the studio. That’s right, from the studio. During my five days in Hawaii, Kanye never slept at his house, or even in a bed. He would, er, power-nap in a studio chair or couch here and there in 90-minute intervals, working through the night. Engineers remained behind the boards 24 hours a day.

      I’m a designer and web developer in San Francisco. I’m currently head of design for Rdio, a new social music service. I was the original designer for EveryBlock, a site that gathers local news and public information and filters it by location to provide “a news feed for your block.” Before co-founding EveryBlock in 2007, I was an interactive designer for Apple, where I worked on the first comprehensive redesign of apple.com in more than 10 years.

      Before I moved to San Francisco in 2006, I worked for the online division of The Lawrence Journal-World, a newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas. I was one of four people that helped create the original version of the Django web framework. I like pie.
