        The Manual is an A5 (~6 × 8") hardback book with a textured, handcrafted feel. Using traditional sewn binding and a partially 
        cotton-wrapped exposed binder’s board cover, it holds nearly 100 pages of 130gsm Munken Pure stock. Each issue has its own color, 
        from the beautiful foil-stamped design on the cover to the spine and illustrations. Line up the full spectrum of these collectible 
        artifacts on your shelf, beginning with the first issue.

          Back in 2009 a small group appeared on Flickr featuring parodies of the infamous Keep Calm and Carry On poster. I was doing a lot 
          of tongue-in-cheek digital illustration at the time so over a few days submitted a number of my own contributions to the group. 
          Some of these have become quite popular, one receiving over 18,000 views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last two years a number of folk have got in touch to see if any of these designs are available to buy as prints or tees. 
          I have dabbled with the idea and put a couple of tee designs up on Spreadshirt last year. However I recently decided to try and 
          take this a bit more seriously so have commissioned some screen prints of two of the more popular designs which are due back from 
          the printer any day now.

          This is why typography is an integral part of what we do and we digitally build upon techniques that have been honed from centuries of man's love of type.

           Each morning begins with a 10 a.m. breakfast at Kanye’s Diamondhead residence. Pusha, Tip, RZA, Cudi, Cons, and Kanye’s crew 
           slowly assemble to enjoy the absurdly tasty cooking of Kanye’s in-house chefs. If you’re smart, you order the French toast 
           with the flambéed banana. An hour later, Kanye pulls up in his Porsche Panamera, fresh from the studio. That’s right, from the 
           studio. During my five days in Hawaii, Kanye never slept at his house, or even in a bed. He would, er, power-nap in a studio 
           chair or couch here and there in 90-minute intervals, working through the night. Engineers remained behind the boards 24 hours 
           a day.

              I’m a designer and web developer in San Francisco. I’m currently head of design for Rdio, a new social music service.
              I was the original designer for EveryBlock, a site that gathers local news and public information and filters it by location 
              to provide “a news feed for your block.” Before co-founding EveryBlock in 2007, I was an interactive designer for Apple, 
              where I worked on the first comprehensive redesign of apple.com in more than 10 years.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Before I moved to San Francisco in 2006, I worked for the online division of The Lawrence Journal-World, a newspaper in 
              Lawrence, Kansas. I was one of four people that helped create the original version of the Django web framework.

              I like pie.
