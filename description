Úll is a conference about building great products, inspired by Apple. The third edition of Úll will attract up to 450 app, mobile and web developers and product designers from all over the world.

Lyrath Estate, a ludicrously attractive conference venue and hotel, in Kilkenny, 90 minutes south of Dublin, is the perfect venue. Úll will take place between 27th–30th April, 2014.

Úll is designed to teach, inspire, and empower attendees with an emphasis on the latest technologies, big ideas, and a welcoming, inclusive atmosphere. We encouraging sponsors, speakers and attendees to mix, to gather, to socialise, to discuss and to maximise serendipity.

Through a unique combination of talks, presentations, installations, interviews, open spaces, and technology, Úll gives us the opportunity to redefine what a technology conference can be. As a sponsor, we’re offering you the chance to engage with our audience in an authentic way.
