    <h2>Logistics</h2>

    <p>
      Úll takes place at the <a href="http://www.theeurope.com">Europe Hotel and Resourt in Killarney</a>. This 5-Star facility boasts an award winning restaurant, and world-renowned spa. There are a number of options available to you for coming to Úll.
    </p>

    <h3>All-inclusive options</h3>

    <p>
      The best way to enjoy Úll is to stay in the hotel for the duration of the conference.
    </p>
